# How to use multiple languages in your Project

Suppose you are creating a site for one of your client, and suddenly he says i need the site to support Russian + German + English. Now you need to do that cause he wants.

so let's start XD

At starting the django doc for language translation looks a bit hard.
But after this article it will look like a piece of cake.


There are two things which comes in handy for language translation

1)  ugettext
2)  ugettext_lazy


set languages
```python
	LANGUAGES = (
    ('en-us', _('English')),
    ('lt', _('Lithunian')),
    ('ru', _('Russian')),
)
```


select a default language
```python
	LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'
```


set LOCAL_PATH in order to save 
```python
	LOCALE_PATHS = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'locale'),
)
```


set this to true
```python
	USE_I18N = True

	USE_L10N = True

```

add locale middleware after session and before common
```python
	MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    ]
```


Now in first load {% load i18n %} in every template
after that use {% trans 'string' %} : string will get replaced by default language
```html
	<p>{% trans 'Hello World' %}</p>
```


Once it is done
enter command to makemessages
```bash
	python manage.py makemessages -l ru  #lt for russian language 
```

It will create a .po file inside Locale directory
it contain the msg id and msgstring 
```python
	msgid "company"
	msgstr "Įmonė" #company in russian
```


now once you filled manually all the msgstr
```bash
	python manage.py compilemessages
```

It will create a .mo file using which django will trnaslate the strings

Now try to load your site.
It will choose the language according to your browser settings

# How to not do entry from file what if client want do fill word alternative on his own

For this use: [django-rosetta](https://django.com/)

It will create forms in admin panel to write alternate of words

```bash
	pip install django-rosetta
```

add it to installed apps

```python
	'rosetta',
```


change the urls.py
```python
	path('rosetta/',include('rosetta.urls')),
```


now try accessing the localhost/rosetta/ it will lead to the admin page to change words



#How to  add language change form in frontend

use [i18n_patterns](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/i18n/translation/#the-set-language-redirect-view)

urls.py
```python
path('i18n/', include('django.conf.urls.i18n')),
```

This url needs post request with language parameter

Post form:
```html
	<form action="{% url 'set_language' %}" method="post">
	{% csrf_token %}
    <input name="next" type="hidden" value="{{ redirect_to }}">
    <select name="language">
        {% get_current_language as LANGUAGE_CODE %}
        {% get_available_languages as LANGUAGES %}
        {% get_language_info_list for LANGUAGES as languages %}
        {% for language in languages %}
            <option value="{{ language.code }}"{% if language.code == LANGUAGE_CODE %} selected{% endif %}>
                {{ language.name_local }} ({{ language.code }})
            </option>
        {% endfor %}
    </select>
    <input type="submit" value="Go">
</form>
```


Now you are good to go
